<p><strong><em>With Company</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em> </em></strong></p>
<ol>
<li>  <strong>Governing Law; Jurisdiction.</strong>This Agreement and all aspects of the Website and Company Services shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the internal laws of the State/Commonwealth of Nevada, without regard to conflict of law provisions. With respect to any disputes or claims not subject to informal dispute resolution or arbitration (as set forth below), you agree not to commence or prosecute any action in connection therewith other than in the state and federal courts located in Washoe County, State of Nevada, and you hereby consent to, and waive all defenses of lack of personal jurisdiction and forum non conveniens with respect to, venue and jurisdiction in such state and federal courts. Application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is excluded from this Agreement. Additionally, application of the Uniform Computer Information Transaction Act (UCITA) is excluded from this Agreement. In no event shall any claim, action or proceeding by you related in any way to the Website or Company Services be instituted more than two (2) years after the cause of action arose.</li>
</ol>
<p> </p>
<ol>
<li>
<strong>Informal Resolution.</strong>To expedite resolution and control the cost of any dispute, controversy or claim related to this Agreement ("Dispute"), you and Company agree to first attempt to negotiate any Dispute (except those Disputes expressly provided below) informally for at least 60 days days before initiating any arbitration or court proceeding. Such informal negotiations commence upon written notice from one person to the other.</li>
</ol>
<p> </p>
<ol>
<li>
<strong>Binding Arbitration.</strong> If you and Company are unable to resolve a Dispute through informal negotiations, either you or Company may elect to have the Dispute (except those Disputes expressly excluded below) finally and exclusively resolved by binding arbitration. Any election to arbitrate by one party shall be final and binding on the other. YOU UNDERSTAND THAT ABSENT THIS PROVISION, YOU WOULD HAVE THE RIGHT TO SUE IN COURT AND HAVE A JURY TRIAL. The arbitration shall be commenced and conducted under the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association ("AAA") and, where appropriate, the AAA’s Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes ("AAA Consumer Rules"), both of which are available at the AAA website www.adr.org. The determination of whether a Dispute is subject to arbitration shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act and determined by a court rather than an arbitrator. Your arbitration fees and your share of arbitrator compensation shall be governed by the AAA Consumer Rules and, where appropriate, limited by the AAA Consumer Rules. If such costs are determined by the arbitrator to be excessive, Company will pay all arbitration fees and expenses. The arbitration may be conducted in person, through the submission of documents, by phone or online. The arbitrator will make a decision in writing, but need not provide a statement of reasons unless requested by a party. The arbitrator must follow applicable law, and any award may be challenged if the arbitrator fails to do so. Except where otherwise required by the applicable AAA rules or applicable law, the arbitration will take place in Washoe County, State of Nevada. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, you and Company may litigate in court to compel arbitration, stay proceedings pending arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate or enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator.</li>
</ol>
<p> </p>
<ol>
<li>
<strong>Restrictions.</strong>You and Company agree that any arbitration shall be limited to the Dispute between Company and you individually. To the full extent permitted by law, (1) no arbitration shall be joined with any other; (2) there is no right or authority for any Dispute to be arbitrated on a class-action basis or to utilize class action procedures; and (3) there is no right or authority for any Dispute to be brought in a purported representative capacity on behalf of the general public or any other persons.</li>
</ol>
<p> </p>
<ol>
<li>
<strong>Exceptions to Informal Negotiations and Arbitration.</strong>You and Company agree that the following Disputes are not subject to the above provisions concerning informal negotiations and binding arbitration: (1) any Disputes seeking to enforce or protect, or concerning the validity of any of your or Company’s intellectual property rights; (2) any Dispute related to, or arising from, allegations of theft, piracy, invasion of privacy or unauthorized use; and (3) any claim for injunctive relief. If this Section is found to be illegal or unenforceable then neither you nor Company will elect to arbitrate any Dispute falling within that portion of this Section found to be illegal or unenforceable and such Dispute shall be decided by a court of competent jurisdiction within the courts listed for jurisdiction above, and you and Company agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of that court.</li>

<p><span><strong>Service Refunds in General:</strong><br>Any claims for service refunds or financial adjustments to your account must be submitted in writing within 30 days of the date such charges were placed on your account.<br><br><a name="rma"></a><strong>Product Returns:</strong><br>IMPORTANT: ALL returns must be issued a Return Merchandise Authorization-RMA and product MUST be returned in original condition and packaging.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>RMA Product Return Process:</strong><br></span><span></span><span></span><span>Step 1: Step 1: Formally request an RMA by email: admin@wrawholesale.com. You will need to provide the Invoice #, the quantity of the item you would like to return and the specific reason. If your have questions regarding your request or require assistance please call 1-775-856-2600 or email sales@wrawholesale.com.</span></p>
<p><span><br>Step 2: We will respond to you with an RMA # and instructions or in some cases deny the return based on the criteria as outlined in our return policy. Our response may take up to two business days from the time we receive all require information. For example if your request is submitted before 5pm Eastern Standard Time (EST) on Friday than the next business is Monday, the second business day is Tuesday, we would have until 5pm EST Tuesday to respond and still meet our service level commitment.</span></p>
<p><span><br>Step 3: Simply follow the RMA instructions you will receive. Do not forget to boldly and clearly label the package with the RMA # we issued. Never just return the package or item to the address on the label or to our 4974 Joule Street address, your package may be refused at your expense or reshipped to the appropriate location at your expense.</span><span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span>45 Day Cycle: 30/15<br>You have 30 days from delivery date to request an RMA, 15 days from RMA issue date to return the product to our warehouse</span></p>
<p><span>Return for Refund:<br>20% Restocking Fee. Refunds are issued in the same payment method, example you used a credit card we will issue the refund to that card.<br></span></p>
<p><span>Return for Exchange:<br>Send product back with RMA per instructions at your expense and we will ship a replacement at ours.<br></span></p>
<p><span>Return for a Store Credit:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>If an item is not available on an exchange transaction we will issue a store credit or if you choose issue a refund less the restocking fee.</span></li>
<li startcont="this"><span>A store credit will be the only option when requesting a refund for a credit card transaction that has expired, typically that is 60 days from the date of capture. In example, we issue you an RMA, you return the item and for some reason it is beyond the expiration date of the transaction, therefore we can not apply it to the Credit Card, in all such cases we will issue a store credit, no exceptions, we will not issue cash refunds for such a transaction because we are still at risk for a charge back. Store credits expire one-year from date of issue.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>Items that CANNOT be Returned:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Unsellable Goods - RMA's will be denied for this purpose. If we are forced to take the product back the restock fee will be double its normal rate and rather then refund we will issue a store credit. We suggest discounting the product or re-marketing the product rather then trying to return for non-sale.<br></span></li>
</ul>
<p><span><strong>Manufacturer &amp; Product Restrictions:</strong></span></p>
<p><span>When purchasing from Wholesale Resort Accessories you are agreeing to strictly adhere to the manufacture distribution, marketing and MAP Pricing restrictions.</span></p>
<p>Minimum Advertised Price (MAP Pricing) is the practice whereby a manufacturer and its distributors agree that the latter's resellers will advertise the former's product at certain prices, at or above a price floor (minimum advertised price).</p>
<p>These rules prevent resellers from competing too fiercely on price, thus driving down profits and lowering the manufacturer's reputation as a creator of quality made products. A manufacturer may do this because it wishes to keep resellers profitable, and thus keeping the manufacturer profitable. Others contend that minimum advertised price maintenance, for instance, overcomes a failure in the market for distributional services by ensuring that distributors who invest in promoting the manufacturer's product are able to recoup the additional costs of such promotion in the price they charge consumers. Manufacturers also defend retail minimum advertised price by saying it ensures fair returns, both for manufacturer. According to such agreements, retailers can usually sell M.A.P. restricted items for any price they choose, but may not display in any print or online advertising, a price below the Minimum Advertisable Price.</p>
<div>
<p><span>Definition: A suppliers pricing policy that does not permit its re-sellers to advertise prices below some specified amount. It can include the re-seller's retail price as well (Source: <a href="http://retail.about.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">retail.about.com</a>)</span></p>
<p><span>IMPORTANT:  Resale of any and all Wholesale Resort Accessories products on/by Online 3rd Party Websites such as Amazon, Ebay and the like is prohibited.</span></p>
